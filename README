X-ray Image Classification and Data Augmentation
This repository contains code for classifying X-ray images as normal or abnormal using a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic X-ray images through data augmentation.
Project Structure:
•	code: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, GAN model, CNN model, and training.
•	data: Stores original and augmented X-ray images.
•	models: Saves trained models.
•	results: Stores output images, loss plots, and other evaluation metrics.
Dependencies:
•	TensorFlow/Keras
•	NumPy
•	OpenCV
•	Scikit-image
Usage:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Install required dependencies.
3.	Prepare your dataset (or use the provided dataset).
4.	Modify hyperparameters in the code as needed.
5.	Run the training script.
Additional Notes:
•	The code includes functions for image preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
•	Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimal performance.
•	Consider exploring different GAN architectures and loss functions.
